# Spy-Robot-Matlab
The main objective for developing the robot is for the surveillance of human activities in the war field or rescue operations. We can easily control the robot using a Mobile IP address and monitor the data. A smart cell phone with IP webcam application is mounted on the robot body for spying purpose even in complete dark by using infrared lighting.
